Arsenal Image Mounter PowerShell Module (a/k/a AIM PowerShell Module) offers more reliable command line functionality when using PowerShell versus the standard AIM CLI that was designed for use with Windows Command Prompt.

Multiple versions of the AIM PowerShell Module can be found in the following "PowerShell" subfolders:

net48: PowerShell 5.x / .NET 4.8
net8.0: PowerShell Core 7.4.x / .NET 8.0
net9.0 PowerShell Core 7.5.x / .NET 9.0

Example of AIM PowerShell Module (net9.0) commands which will import the module, mount a disk image, list the disk's volumes, list the mount points, and finally dismount the disk image:

PS C:\> Import-Module 'C:\Arsenal-Image-Mounter-v3.11.299\PowerShell\net9.0\Arsenal.ImageMounter.PowerShell.dll'

PS C:\> $vdisk = New-AimVirtualDisk -FileName "(Path to Disk Image)" -WriteOverlayMem -Online

PS C:\> Get-AimDiskVolumes $vdisk
\\?\Volume{152a6400-e077-4c27-ae79-41f916c4f629}\
\\?\Volume{0c06df19-1a83-42a6-927c-3531a1db8093}\
\\?\Volume{3a0b61ea-4c9a-4e9e-9f98-4dd10f88d9ed}\
