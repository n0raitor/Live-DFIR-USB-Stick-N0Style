On the Windows machine you want to audit, run the 'RunRedlineAudit.bat' script, preferably from removable media (e.g. a USB Hard Drive). The script will run the Collector, as you configured it, and save the results to a folder named 'Sessions\AnalysisSession1'. Every time you run the script, a new AnalysisSession folder (AnalysisSession2, AnalysisSession3, etc.) is created.

When the collection is finished, transfer the results back to your analysis machine, then double-click 'AnalysisSession.mans' file located inside the AnalysisSession folder.
