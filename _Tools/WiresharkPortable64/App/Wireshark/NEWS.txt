Wireshark 4.0.8 Release Notes

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  We do not ship official 32-bit Windows packages for Wireshark 4.0 and
  later. If you need to use Wireshark on that platform, we recommend
  using the latest 3.6 release. Issue 17779[1]

  If you’re running Wireshark on macOS and upgraded to macOS 13 from an
  earlier version, you might have to open and run the “Uninstall
  ChmodBPF” package, then open and run “Install ChmodBPF” in order to
  reset the ChmodBPF Launch Daemon. Issue 18734[2].

  locations on your system.
